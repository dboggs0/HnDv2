Damage:
The amount of damage dealt by a collision event (either with a vehicle/structure model or a projectile) is determined by the qualitative damage rating assigned to each player/enemy object in the Functional Specification:
    Low		    -1 HP
    Medium	    -2 HP
    High		-3 HP
After HP is removed from an object a check will be made to determine if the object’s HP is less than or equal to 0.  
If so, the object destruction method will be called.

Destruction:
When an object is destroyed a destruction animation will play, and a destruction sound will be played.  
After 2 seconds the object instance will be destroyed.  
In the case of the player’s airplane the “game over” events will be triggered
